# Angular Skeleton

This is a sample Angular application, using Angular Material for visual design.
I've used this layout for mulitple projects, as it's straightforward and easily
understood by users. The skeleton serves as a starting point for future projects.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.
