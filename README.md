# Angular Skeleton

This is a sample Angular application, using Angular Material for visual design.
I've used this layout for mulitple projects, as it's straightforward and easily
understood by users. The skeleton serves as a starting point for future projects.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1
as follows:

> ng new angular-skeleton
> - Angular routing: Yes
> - Stylesheet format: SCSS
>
> cd angular-skeleton
> ng add @angular/material
> - Prebuilt theme: Indigo/Pink
> - Material typography: No
> - Angular animations: Include and enable
