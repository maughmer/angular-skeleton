  Dashboard content here.
  <p>
    A dashboard usually contains items of some importance, that need to be addressed
    right away: notices to be sent, reports that need to be completed, newly submitted
    loan applications, etc.

    To the left, a nav bar shows other topics that may be of interest to the user. Where
    I'm using placeholders, selections may include such things as Clients, Projects, and
    Users for a business app, Men, Women, and Kids for a clothing app, or Characters,
    Games, and Systems for a table-top roleplaying app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, Stuff is a special item that will show a sub-menu of topics related to, but not
    belonging, amongst the items at the top level. If instead named Women, for example,
    selecting it could open a new nav bar showing such things as Accessories, Clothing,
    and Shoes.
