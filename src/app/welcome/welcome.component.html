<main>
  <h3>Welcome to Angular Skeleton</h3>
  <p>
    This is a sample Angular application, using Angular Material for visual design.
    I've used this layout for mulitple projects, as it's straightforward and easily
    understood by users. The skeleton serves as a starting point for future projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    A welcome page gives users a description of the app and prompts them to log in,
    though the welcome page may be dropped in favor of sending users directly to
    login.
  </p>
  <p>
    Go ahead and log in. The sample app is not connected to a back end service, so
    does not actually perform any login verification. Any email and password will do.
